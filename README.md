# Gleb Bahmutov

> Public talks, presentations (old)

I currently host all my presentations at [slides.com/bahmutov](https://slides.com/bahmutov) -
I found it simpler and faster for creating presentations that includes images.

All my presentations are [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) text files (with .md extensions).
I usually use [slides-now](http://glebbahmutov.com/slides-now/) to actually present them.
Just drag and drop the .md file into the page.

You can find most of the tools references in the presentations at
[my website](http://glebbahmutov.com/), [github](https://github.com/bahmutov)
and [npm](https://npmjs.org/browse/author/bahmutov)
